            new programming language or a new skill in my artistic pursuits. <br><br>

        <p>One of my biggest passions is drawing, and I have been practicing this art form for many years. I love the
            freedom and creativity that comes with putting pen to paper and bringing my ideas to life. I also enjoy
            exploring different mediums and styles, from traditional pencil drawings to digital paintings. <br><br>
