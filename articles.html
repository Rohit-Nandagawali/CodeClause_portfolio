            <h1 class="section-heading">Why Choose React For Web Development in 2023?</h1>
            <p class="project-desc">React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook that allows you to write user interfaces and create apps. It has been around since 2013 but has only recently become popular among developers. In fact, according to the Stack Overflow Developer Survey, React is now the most popular JavaScript framework among web developers for web development! Before React, Angular JS, Ember JS, and Ajax were taking the privilege of web and app development. <br><br>

                The main reason why React is so popular is that it offers developers an easy way to create applications with a lot of functionality at once. This means that your app doesn’t need to be as complicated as other frameworks; instead, you can focus on building features in your app rather than how to get those features up and running on the web. This can help make your app easier for users to understand and use! There are multiple platforms based on React to create web applications, mobile applications, and cross-hybrid platforms for desktops. <br><br>
                
                Another benefit of using React is that it doesn’t require any knowledge of HTML or CSS before getting started with development. You don’t need any experience with either one before using React; all you need is an understanding of JavaScript syntax and how functions work within the language itself! That being said let’s understand what are the advantages of using React as your web development framework.</p>
